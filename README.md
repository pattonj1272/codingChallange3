The answer is 7.00 AM Saturday (A)

Explanation 
 - First add 12 to get the hours the same then add the remaning three days to come up with 12 + 24 * 3 = 84
 - Second calculate minutes from hour to get a single unit to do math with 84 * 60 = 5,040
 - Third calculate how many minutes it takes to reduce by 1 minute (5,040 / (5 + 7)) = 420 minutes 
 - Fourth convert back into hours 420 / 60 = 7 hours
 - Fifth calculate how many hours to loose 5 minutes 5 * 7 = 35 hours
 - Sixth add one day and the 11 hours to the start time. 11:00 + 20:00 = 1 day + 7:00. Thursday + (1 + 1) day = Saturday. 

Basically one calculate how often minute is lost per x minutes, figure out how many minutes need to wait to get back on time, convert back into form days and hours.
